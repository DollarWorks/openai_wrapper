    You should express what you want a model to do by \
    providing instructions that are as clear and \
    specific as you can possibly make them. \
    This will guide the model towards the desired output, \
    and reduce the chances of receiving irrelevant \
    or incorrect responses. Don't confuse writing a \
    clear prompt with writing a short prompt. \
    In many cases, longer prompts provide more clarity \
    and context for the model, which can lead to \
    more detailed and relevant outputs.
